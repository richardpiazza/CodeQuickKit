## ðŸ“Œ Features

Features in this project are largely grouped around how the apply-to or extend existing frameworks:

### Swift Core Library

* **Dependency Management**:
    `DependencyCache` offers a singleton approach to managing service and configuration dependencies throughout an application.
    The cache is configured by passing a `DependencySupplier` to the `configure(with:)` function.
    A _dependency_ can be directly resolved from the _cache_ using `resolve<T>() throws -> T`, or the `Dependency` property wrapper can be used to lazily reference as needed:
  
  ```swift
  @Dependency private var someService: SomeService
  ```

### Foundation

* **UserDefaults**:
    `UserDefault` is a property wrapper designed to interact with the `UserDefaults` storage.
  
  ```swift
  @UserDefault("counter", defaultValue: 0) var counter: Int
  ```

### UIKit

* **UIAlertController.ActivityAlertController**:
  
  ThisÂ *hack*Â creates a alert dialog with a progress indicator and optional title/messaging strings.

### SwiftUI

* **ActivityAlertView**
  
  A SwiftUI workaround for using the `ActivityAlertController`. (UIKit Only)
